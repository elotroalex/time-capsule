On April 2013, a new oak tree was planted in place of the Lincoln Oak
that Hurricane Sandy overturned the year before. The planting served as
part of a celebration, which took place on the Green, of the 375th
anniversary of New Haven's founding. Several important members of the
New Haven community came together to help plant the new tree, including
former mayor John DeStefano, the Urban Resources Initiative, Common
Ground and Sound students, and more. During the celebration, the city
exhibited photos and information of the time capsule and its contents.
New Haven citizens showed up to learn about the uncovered mystery and to
see if their guesses about what might be held inside the capsule were
correct.

The following year, the New Haven Museum curated an exhibition to
commemorate the uprooting of the Lincoln Oak and the objects found
beneath it. Titled"Nothing is Set in Stone: The Lincoln Oak and the New
Haven Green," the presentation ran from April 2014 to January 2015. It
featured artworks by local New Haven artists, who repurposed pieces of
the old Lincoln Oak tree. The Museum also included scientific
information about the skeletal remains that were uncovered in the Green,
as well as the items that were found in the two time capsules. Several
research organizations in New Haven contributed to the curation.

Today, the New Haven Museum preserves the time capsule, though it is not
publicly exhibited. Like many of the Museum's treasures, the capsule is
located at the Whitman Library, and researchers must request access to
it. The objects,the time capsule, and the Abraham Lincoln sculpture made
from the wood of the Lincoln Memorial Oak fallen in 2012 are all neatly
cataloged and organized for anyone interested in seeing, touching, or
reading any of them. But visitors need to know what they are looking
for. That is where librarians come into the picture. People like Ed
Surato are happy to respond to users' needs and curiosity, open to
assist with obtaining digital scans of any items or finding out further
information.

But why is a time capsule that was buried in 1909 important to us today?
More than anything, the historical objects it contains provide valuable
insight to the history of New Haven. From the business cards to the
military records in the capsule, all of these materials give us a taste
of what life was like in the early 20th century. The newspaper articles
feature stories that range from bills killed by the New Haven
legislature to plans to celebrate the Lincoln Centennial in the city.
All of these artifacts and texts come together to paint a picture of the
values and traditions of New Haven from over a hundred years ago. This
glimpse into the past becomes even more interesting when we compare it
to contemporary New Haven. With today's advancements in technology and
more progressive social views, quite a lot has changed from the time
this capsule was put together. Still, some things remain the same: one
newspaper features a critique of Yale University buildings, a
conversation that continues today.

Overall, the time capsule and the information surrounding it serve as
educational resources for a city rich in history. Though the Museum has
no further projects planned with the time capsule, we should continue to
learn from it to keep expanding our knowledge of New Haven and its
people.
