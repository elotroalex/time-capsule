"Uprooted" is a collaborative Digital Humanities project conceived as part of Introduction to Digital Humanities: Part I: Architectures of Knowledge, a Fall 2022 course at Yale University. Our team consists of the students in this course, Isabela Alvarado, Madeleine Cepeda-Hanley, Estelle Gu√©ville, Michelle Lacoste Adunka, Alan Mendoza, and Serena Strecker as well as the instructor for the course, Alex Gil. Michelle Lacoste Adunka originally proposed the 1909 New Haven time capsule as a potential subject for digitization and digital exhibition to the class based on her connection with Ed Surato at the New Haven Museum. Through consensus-based decision-making, we decided to pursue the time capsule as the subject of our final project: a collaboratively designed and executed digital collection. 

We have sought to implement a collaborative workflow rooted in consensus-based decision-making on issues that relate to the project as a whole including the project's design, content, and team roles.
